### What You Need for Lobster Hooping:

1. **License**
2. **Lobster Card**
   - Make sure to get a location ID and fill it out on your card.
   - Fill the lobster card when you’re in the parking lot to avoid getting a ticket.
   - For new locations, fill out the lobster number and mark the new location on the card.
   - Mark "0" if you catch nothing. Only count legal-sized lobsters, not short ones or those you throw back.

### Where to Find Lobsters:

- Lobsters thrive in environments with current, food, and structure (similar to calico bass and sand bass).
- Look for:
  - **Rocks, reefs, and artificial structures** that resemble caves.
  - **Other species**: Sculpins and eels might also be in the water.
  - Check what’s in your net before transferring it to your kayak.

### Rigging:

- **Extension Cord Winder**:
  - Attach reflective tape to it.
  - Mark your rope every 5-10 feet with a zip tie.
  - If hooping in a 25-foot area, mark with 3 zip ties.

### Bait Tips:

1. **Bait Selection**:
   - Avoid bait that will dissipate quickly.
   - Cut bait into chunks of 2-3 inches.
   - Don’t chop bait too finely.
   - Soak a sponge in lobster scent.
   - Freeze the bait cage to prolong the scent in the water.
2. **Baiting Process**:
   - Perform cuts at home, not on the boat.
   - Don’t re-bait, just re-scent.
3. **Bait Recommendations**: Mention of "Bidon juice" as a bait option.

### Miscellaneous Tips:

- **Public Auctions**: Look at auctions for nets.
- **Game Wardens**: They are less likely to bother you if you’re organized and keep things clean.
- **Lobster Behavior**: Lobsters are picky; they won’t share space with crabs.

### Tides & Timing:

- **Lobster Movement**: Lobsters crawl out and back during the night.
- **Moon Phase**:
   - Lobsters don’t like full moons.
   - It’s important to understand the moon rise/set times.
   - In Long Beach, lobsters are used to artificial light.
   - Overcast weather or storms can turn off lobster activity.
- **Opening Day**: It's often too hectic and crowded.
